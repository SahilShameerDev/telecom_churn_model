# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction Model

## Overview
This project involves the development of a churn prediction model for a telecom company using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The goal is to predict which customers are likely to churn (leave the service) based on various features such as demographics, account information, and service usage patterns.


## Introduction
Customer churn is a significant issue in the telecom industry. Identifying customers who are likely to churn can help in devising strategies to retain them. This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to create a predictive model for customer churn.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this model contains information on 10,000 telecom customers. The dataset includes the following key columns:

- Customer ID
- Geography
- Gender
- Age
- Tenure
- Balance
- Number of Products
- Has Credit Card
- Is Active Member
- Estimated Salary
- Exited (Target variable)
## Summary Statistics
 - Total Number of Customers: 10,000
 - Total Exited Customers: 2,037
 - Total Non-Exited Customers: 7,963

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The exploratory data analysis (EDA) provided insights into the distribution and relationships between features and the target variable. Key findings include:

Geography-wise Exit Ratio:

- France: 18%
- Spain: 20%
- Germany: 33%
Gender-wise Exit Ratio:

- Male: 22%
- Female: 24%

## Conclusion
The SVM-based churn prediction model provides a reliable tool for identifying customers at risk of leaving. This can help the telecom company in taking proactive measures to retain customers, thereby reducing churn rates and increasing customer satisfaction.
